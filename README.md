## Communication Protocol

### BLE SPP Service
- **Service UUID**: `0xABF0`
- **Data Characteristic**: `0xABF2`
- **VESC Data Packet**: 14 bytes (temperature, current, RPM, voltage)
- **BMS Data Packet**: 41 bytes (voltage, current, capacity, cell voltages)
  - **Compatible BMS**: Jaiabaida and Kaly BMS systems
  - **Cell Monitoring**: Up to 16 individual cell voltages
  - **Capacity Data**: Remaining and nominal capacity tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ESP-IDF development environment
- Compatible ESP32 development board
- TFT LCD display
- Analog throttle potentiometer

### Build & Flash
```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

### Configuration
1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32
2. Calibrate the throttle input on first use
3. Configure VESC parameters in the settings
4. Pair with your electric skateboard's BLE server

### Current Limitations
- **Skateboard Parameters**: Wheel pulley, wheel size, and motor parameters are currently embedded in the firmware
- **Configuration Tool**: No external configuration tool is available yet - parameters must be modified in the source code
- **UI Development**: The user interface is developed using SquareLine Studio and requires the SquareLine Studio project files for modifications

## Use Cases

- **Electric Skateboards**: Primary use case with VESC motor controllers
- **Electric Scooters**: Compatible with similar motor control systems
- **DIY Electric Vehicles**: Customizable for various electric vehicle applications
- **Research & Development**: Open-source platform for electric vehicle control research

## BMS Compatibility

This controller is specifically designed to work with popular electric skateboard BMS systems:

- **Jaiabaida BMS**: Full telemetry support including cell voltages and capacity data
- **Kaly BMS**: Complete compatibility with all monitoring features
- **Custom BMS**: Extensible protocol for other BMS systems
